FragmentAnimations
==================

Shared Element Animation Transition example adapted for Fragments. 
DevBytes, hosted by Chet Hasse, included a tutorial about overriding the standard window manager at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPxkoe2MraA. 
yrizk adapted this example to play a shared element animations between two fragments between the same activity.

I adapted yrizk's code to better match today's standards when dealing with fragments and to fix some quirks. Contribuitions welcome!
