FragmentAnimations
==================

Shared Element Animation Transition example adapted for Fragments. 
DevBytes, hosted by Chet Hasse, included a tutorial about overriding the standard window manager at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPxkoe2MraA. 
yrizk adapted this example to play a shared element animations between two fragments between the same activity using ViewAnimatorProperty API , which is available since API 12+

Let me warn you, the .gitignore is in bad shape (nudge nudge).
