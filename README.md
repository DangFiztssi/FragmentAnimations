FragmentAnimations
==================

Shared Element Animation Transition example adapted for Fragments. 
DevBytes, hosted by Chet Hasse, included a tutorial about overriding the standard window manager at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPxkoe2MraA. 
yrizk adapted this example to play a shared element animations between two fragments between the same activity.

Special thanks to pabloff9 for some updates, definetly was not expecting that. if you feel so inclined, feel free to conribute. 
Let me warn you, the .gitignore is in bad shape (nudge nudge).
