FragmentAnimations
==================

Shared Element Animation Transition example adapted for Fragments. 
DevBytes, hosted by Chet Hasse, included a tutorial about overriding the standard window manager at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPxkoe2MraA. 
I adapted this example to play a shared element animations between two fragments between the same activity.
